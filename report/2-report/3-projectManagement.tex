\chapter{Project Management}
In order to manage the project, the code as well as the project tasks were stored in a GitHub repository.

That choice was made because I already had previous experience storing my code and repositories in GitHub but also because the way GitHub does project management was very suitable for the approach that I was using to develop the project.

Using SCRUM terms, GitHub facilitates the planning of sprints and tasks by its use of issues and milestones, but also because it makes it very easy to keep track of how the project is evolving through the use of Kanban boards. It is also possible to assign the different tasks to different sprints and to users, to that everyone that is involved in the project knows where the project is and what they need to do.

In this particular case, I developed the whole project myself, but I still found it very useful to use the features provided by GitHub, especially because it allows me to comment on the tasks as I am getting them done, allowing me to have a log of the progress that I have made over time, as well as register the difficulties that I had to face and how I overcame them.
